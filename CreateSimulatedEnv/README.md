# Construction of simulated metagenomic environmnets

Our simulated metagenomic environments are created with a Snakemake pipeline. 
We provide a list of species names that we sampled from in "species_list.txt".

Additionally, we provide the damage profiles used to simulate the three levels of damage.
1. High damage rate was taken from Günther, Torsten, et al. "Ancient genomes link early farmers from Atapuerca in Spain to modern-day Basques." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 112.38 (2015): 11917-11922.
2. Medium damage rate was taken from Olalde, Iñigo, et al. "Derived immune and ancestral pigmentation alleles in a 7,000-year-old Mesolithic European." Nature 507.7491 (2014): 225-228.
3. No damage rate.
