# Database creation

To create euka's current database and taxa-based pangenome graph we use the Snakemake pipeline in this directory. All files needed for the pipeline are provided in this folder. 

The database and the constructed graph need approximatly 18.3GB of storage space. 
A table of all sequences, their accession numbers and their sorted taxon can be found in the eukaDB.tex file. 

All scripts are using abolut paths to the files and would need to be adjusted when recreating this database.
