# Database creation

To create euka's current database and taxa-based pangenome graph we provide a Snakemake pipeline. All files needed for the pipeline are provided in this folder. 
The database and the constructed graph need approximatly 18.3GB of storage space. 
A table of all sequences, their accession numbers and their sorted taxon can be found in the eukaDB.tex file.
